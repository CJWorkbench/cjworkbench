Bootstrap-ish components.

How they were created:

1. We used [Reactstrap](http://reactstrap.github.io/components/alerts/)
2. We ran into problems
3. We tried and tried to stay with Reactstrap
4. We nixed Reactstrap and rewrote a bunch of elements.

Editing? Try to stick close to
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) norms.
The one giant exception is in using Popper. We use lots of Popper.
