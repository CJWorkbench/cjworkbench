  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Inflation is the rate of increase in prices over a given period of time. Historical dollar amounts cannot be directly compared with today's dollars, because all prices slowly change over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson, we’ll learn how to compare dollar amounts from different years using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    We'll adjust teacher salaries dating back from 1969 in order to get an accurate picture of how much teachers have
    been paid over time.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    In step 1 of the tab <kbd>Salaries</kbd> we loaded a prepared table using data published by the National Center for Education Statistics, <a class="highlight" href='https://nces.ed.gov/' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It shows the average annual salaries of teachers in U.S. public elementary and secondary schools between 1969 and 2016.
    Those numbers are in “Current dollars”, which means not adjusted for inflation. Let's convert them into today’s dollars.
  </p>
  <p>
    To do this we need a measure of inflation. Every month the Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys the prices of
    hundreds of consumer items to produce a number known as the “Consumer Price Index” or CPI. The
    <kbd>CPI data</kbd> tab contains this data, published <a class="highlight" href='https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUUR0000SA0/' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a>.

  <h2>Cleaning</h2>
  <p>
    Both original spreadsheets contain one or several rows of notes before the actual data, which means we don’t get proper column names.<br>
    Let’s also fix the types, and remove anything we don’t need.

  <h2>Using CPI</h2>
  <p>
     In order to convert a current dollar amount (old) into an adjusted dollar
     amount (new), we need to divide the current dollar amount by the CPI
     for that year, then multiply it by the CPI for the present year.
  </p>
  <div class="copy-txt">adjusted=(current/old CPI)*new CPI</div>

  <p>
    To do this, we need to get the CPI numbers into the same tab as the teacher salary data. We can do this by “joining” these tabs.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="fullscreen">
  <h2>How join works</h2>
  <p>
    Joins are used to augment the information contained in one table with the information contained in another table.
    Two tables can be joined when they have at least one column with identical values.<br>
    Tab 1 and 2 below share the column <kbd>First name</kbd>. Each table contains one other column of data associated with the values in <kbd>First name</kbd>.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img alt="Inspect element" class="three-quarter-width" src="./join-example-1.png">
  </figure>
  <p>
    When joining Tab 1 and Tab 2 on <kbd>First name</kbd>, values in that column are matched, and corresponding values from the other tab are appended.
  </p>
  <figure >
    <img alt="Inspect element" class="half-width" src="./join-example-2.png">
  </figure>
  <p>
    Joins can reveal new insights by bringing two sources of information together that may not mean much independently. A famous (and recurring) story joins school bus drivers with convicted felons.

  <h2>Joining tables</h2>
  <p>
    Since both tables have a year variable, we’ll join them on the column <kbd>Year</kbd>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleSlugs[3] === 'jointab'"
      >Switch back to the <kbd>Salaries</kbd> tab and add a <kbd>Join tab</kbd> step
    </li>
    <li
      data-test="
        const params = workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[3].params
        return (
          params.right_tab === 'tab-2'
          && params.join_columns.on.join('|') === 'Year'
        )
      ">Select the <kbd>CPI data</kbd> tab to join with, and the <kbd>Year</kbd> column to join on
    <li
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[3].params.join_columns.right.includes('Annual')"
      >The final step is to choose which columns to bring in from the CPI tab. Select <kbd>Annual</kbd>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        We now have one table containing all the information we need for our analysis

  <h2>Using CPI</h2>
  <p>
    The formula for converting a current dollar amount into an adjusted dollar amount is:
  </p>
  <div class="copy-txt">adjusted=(current/old CPI)*new CPI</div>
  <p>
    We need to divide each yearly salary by its associated CPI value, then multiply the result by the CPI for the
    reference year (the year we are adjusting all the dollar values to match.)
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case the reference year is 2016, which has as a CPI of <kbd>240.007</kbd>.

        return (
          f === '=(B1/C1)*240.007'

    <li
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[4].params.out_column.toLowerCase() === 'adjusted salaries'"
      >Name this new column <kbd>Adjusted salaries</kbd>
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        Dollar values which are adjusted for inflation are also called “real” dollars, while non-adjusted amounts
        are sometimes called “nominal” dollars.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        We can see that the salaries of teachers in U.S. public elementary and secondary schools decreased from 2009 to 2016, in real dollar terms, which is not apparent in the non-adjusted data.
