  <h1>Introduction to data types</h1>
  <p>Understanding data type is essential. Some operations only work on specific types.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Data types tell computers how to interpret and use values.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each Workbench column has a type: text, numbers, dates or timestamps. Each type empowers you to use a certain set of steps. Use "text" to search for keywords; use "numbers" to subtract.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson, we will use data on incidents reported by the New York City police to learn how to convert columns between types.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    The table loaded in step 1 describes all felonies reported by the New York City police for the months of January and February 2018.
    The original is published <a class="highlight" href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/data' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a> with a data dictionary.
  </p>
  <p class="instruction-detail">Again, let’s ask the basic questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What does each row represent?</li>
    <li>What's in each column?</li>
    <li>Are there any columns, values or codes you don't understand?</li>
    <li>Are there missing or obviously wrong values?</li>
    <li>Does the data need to be cleaned?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>Cleaning</h2>
  <p>
    There's a lot you might want to explore in this data. In the next lesson, we will look at a larger sample and
    answer the question: "How many incidents were reported each month in each borough?"
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, let’s narrow it down to the columns we need and set column types correctly.

  <h2>Data types</h2>
  <p>
     Workbench supports four column types. The type of each column is displayed below the column name:
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img class="half-width" alt="Inspect element" src="./type-header.png">
  </figure>
  <h3>Text</h3>
  <p>
    Each value is a sequence of characters, also known as “string”. Text is great for names, descriptions, notes and categories. CSV files store text exclusively.
  </p>
  <h3>Number</h3>
  <p>
    Each value can be a whole number (such as 8 or -268) or a decimal (such as 1.5 or 3.14). Numbers are great for sorting and math.
  </p>
  <h3>Timestamp</h3>
  <p>
    Each value is an “instant” in time, with nanosecond precision. Timestamps are great for sorting and math.
  </p>
  <p>
    Timestamps have no timezone: an event happens at the same timestamp everywhere in the world, regardless of local clocks. Timestamps are stored in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a cousin of Greenwich Mean Time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Workbench displays timestamps in ISO-8601 format: “2019–01-23T11:42:00Z”.
  </p>
  <h3>Date</h3>
  <p>
    Each value is a calendar day. Dates are great for grouping and charting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike timestamps, date values <em>do</em> have a timezone. Workbench does not store the timezone, though, because common sense is usually enough. For example, everybody reading a Workbench report on traffic stops in New York should assume dates are in Eastern Time.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Date column has a <em>unit</em>: day, week, month, quarter, or year. A column with a unit of “week” only stores Mondays. The unit determines how Workbench displays dates in tables and charts.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Converting dates</h2>
  <p>
    Although the <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> column looks like a date, you can see that it was loaded as text.
  </p>
  <figure class="half-width">
    <img alt="Inspect element" src="./type.png">
  </figure>
  <p>
    Let’s clean this data by setting the type of the <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> column to date.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-test="
        const step = workflow.tabs[0].steps[3]
        return step &amp;&amp; step.moduleSlug === 'converttexttodate' &amp;&amp;
               step.params.colnames.join('|').toLowerCase() === 'complaint date'
               &amp;&amp; step.params.format === 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    ">
      In the column menu <span><img class="icon-insert" src="images/lesson-icons/menu.svg" /></span> for the <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> column, select <kbd>Convert to date</kbd>. This will add a conversion step.
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        Now this column has “Date” type. We'll use this cleaned column in the next lesson.
