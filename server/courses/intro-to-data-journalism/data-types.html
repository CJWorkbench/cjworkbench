  <p>Different columns have different types: text, numbers, dates, locations, and so on. Some operations only work on specific types.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Data types tell computers how to interpret and use values.
  </p>
  <p>
    Different columns have different types: text, numbers, dates, locations, and so on. Some operations only work on specific types. For example, you can’t subtract text from a number.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson we will use data on reported police incidents in New York to learn how to convert columns between types.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    This table was describes all felonies reported by the police of New York City for the months of January and February 2018. The original is published <a class="highlight" href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/data' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a> with a data dictionary.
  </p>
  <p class="instruction-detail">Again, let’s ask the basic questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What does each row represent?</li>
    <li>What's in each column?</li>
    <li>Are there any columns, values or codes you don't understand?</li>
    <li>Are there missing or obviously wrong values?</li>
    <li>Does the data need to be cleaned?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>Cleaning</h2>
  <p>
    There's a lot of interesting data points you may want to explore in this data. In the next lesson, we will look at a larger sample and answer the question: "How many incidents were reported each month in each borough?"
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, let’s narrow it down to the columns we need and set column types correctly.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleSlugs[1] === 'selectcolumns' && workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[1].params.colnames === 'boro_nm,cmplnt_fr_dt'"
      >Add Select columns, and keep only <kbd>boro_nm</kbd> and <kbd>cmplnt_fr_dt</kbd>.
    </li>
    <li
      data-test="const wfm = workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[2]; return wfm && !wfm.params.custom_list && wfm.params.renames.boro_nm === 'Borough' && wfm.params.renames.cmplnt_fr_dt === 'Complaint date'"
      >Rename these two columns respectively to <kbd>Borough</kbd> and <kbd>Complaint date</kbd>.
      <p class="instruction-detail">Before going further, let's learn a little more about data types.</p>

  <h2>Data types</h2>
  <p>
     Workbench supports three column types. The type of each column is displayed below each column name:
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img class="half-width" alt="Inspect element" src="images/course-1/type-header.png">
  </figure>
  <h3>Text</h3>
  <p>
    Also known as “string”, this type can contain any character and can be of any length. Text is great for names, descriptions, notes and categories.
  </p>
  <h3>Number</h3>
  <p>
    This type is used for whole numbers (such as 8, 22 or 268) and decimals (such as 1.5 or 3.14). Numbers are great for sorting and math.
  </p>
  <h3>Date &amp; time</h3>
  <p>
    This type stores points in time, with nanosecond precision. Dates &amp; times are great for sorting and grouping records.
  </p>
  <p>
    A "Date &amp; time" value can be written in many formats, such as “23 January 2019 11:42.” Right now, date &amp; time in Workbench is shown as “2019–01-23 11:42:00”.
  </p>
  <p>
    Workbench does not currently support time zones.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Converting dates</h2>
  <p>
    Although the <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> column looks like a date, you can see that it was loaded as text.
  </p>
  <figure class="half-width">
    <img alt="Inspect element" src="images/course-1/type.png">
  </figure>
  <p>
    Let’s clean this data by setting the type of the <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> column to date &amp; time.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-test="const wfm = workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[3]; return wfm && wfm.moduleSlug === 'convert-date' && wfm.params.colnames === 'Complaint date' && wfm.params.input_format === 'auto'"
      >In the column menu<span>
        <img class="icon-insert" src="images/lesson-icons/menu.svg">
      </span> for the <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> column, select <kbd>Convert to date &amp; time</kbd>. This will add a conversion step.
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        Now this column has a “Date &amp; Time” type. We will use this cleaned column in the next lesson.
