    This entry level course will teach you how to answer questions with data in a transparent
    and reproducible manner, without the need to code.

    You will learn how to filter, group, create charts, fix common data formatting issues, and combine different
    data sets. Youâ€™ll also learn about useful calculations like per capita rates, percentage change, and adjusting
    for inflation.
    </br></br>
    Along the way, you'll work with data that journalists commonly use, including campaign finance, crime,
    housing, and environmental data.
