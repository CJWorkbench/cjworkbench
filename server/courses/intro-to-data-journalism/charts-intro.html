  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Not all data stories need a data visualization. If you have only one or two numbers, they can probably just appear as text in the final story. With more data, charts are essential to quickly convey large amounts of information to your audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Charts are also useful as an intermediary step in your analysis. You can use charts to identify areas of interest in your data and oriente your research without necessarily having the intention to show them to your readers.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson we will work with the same dataset we used in the first lesson, containing international data on the 10 largest CO<sub>2</sub> emitters since 2010.

  <h2>When to transpose</h2>
  <p>
    Let's visualy compare the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by China to that of other countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    But first, let's look closely at our table.<br/>
    In Workbench charts are plotted by selecting data in columns.
  </p>
  <p>
    We cannot select <kbd>China</kbd>, because it is displayed as a row.
    Likewise, there is no column <kbd>Year</kbd> to select. Instead, each year is its own column.
  </p>
  <p class="instruction-detail">
    If we want to select variables that are displayed as rows, we must turn them into columns. This is called transposing.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="fullscreen">
  <h2>How Transpose works</h2>
  <p>
    Transposing turns rows into columns and columns into rows. Doing so, it swaps the header with the left-most column.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the left-most column in fig.1 becomes a header in fig.2, you will often have to rename the new left-most column in fig.2.

  <h2>Transpose in action</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s transpose the table and compare the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by China through the years.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, we need to remove the <kbd>Continent</kbd> column. If we transpose this column (you should try!), it will appear as an extra non-numeric row, and it will cause an error when we try to plot.

  <h2>When to use a line chart</h2>
  <p>
    If column charts are a good choice to visually compare how much CO<sub>2</sub> is produced by individual countries in a given time frame, a line chart is better for showing trends through time.
    The reason is that continuity can be established between points in time, and so a line can be drawn to help viewers grasp the direction of the change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Line charts, however, should not be used with anything else than a horizontal axis representing time. Drawing a line between ’China’ and ‘Russia’, would make no sense: There is no in-between value, and the chart would show something that doesn’t exist.
