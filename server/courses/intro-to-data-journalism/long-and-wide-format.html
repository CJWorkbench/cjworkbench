  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Data can be organized into tables in different ways. In this lesson, you will learn to recognize “long” and “wide” formats and convert from one to another, which is called reshaping.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson we will work with a month of the same data we used in the previous lesson, on police incident reported in the City of New York.

  <p><b>Long format</b> tables contain only one column with measured values.<br>In this case <kbd>Count of incidents</kbd>. All other columns are variables that describe what is measured.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each row is a unique combination of those variables.<br> In this case, each available <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> is combined with each unique <kbd>Borough</kbd>.

  <p>
    <b>Wide formats</b> are the most common table format. In a wide format. there are one or more columns that describe what is measured, in this case <kbd>Complaint date</kbd>. These columns are called “Row variables".<br>
    All other column names are called "Column variables", as they also describe what is measured - in this case each <kbd>Borough</kbd>. All remaining cells contain the actual measurements.

  <h2>Converting to wide format</h2>
  <p>
    Our goal is to visualize the volume of incidents reported in each borough, for each day.
  </p>
  <p>
    All dates must be in one column so that we can select it as the X axis, and each borough must be in its own column, so that we can pick and choose which we want to compare.

  <h2>Visualizing</h2>
  <p>
    Finally, we’re ready to visualize our grouped police incident data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s visually compare the volume of reported police incidents in each borough, using a line chart.
  </p>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add a line chart.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Choose <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> for the X axis.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add <span>
        <img class="icon-insert" src="images/lesson-icons/add.svg">
      </span>one column on the Y axis for each <kbd>Borough</kbd> you want to compare.
    </li>
  </ol>
