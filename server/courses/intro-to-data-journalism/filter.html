  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Filtering data is a common, yet powerful analysis technique. You can use it to answer questions such as “Which cities spent more than 5 million dollars on public transit infrastructure last year?”
  </p>
  <p>
    Filtering is also a key intermediate step in many analyses, or for exploring data you are just starting to work with.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson we will work with open data from the City of San Francisco, on planned affordable housing.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>The data we're using in this lesson, loaded in step 1, is a quarterly snapshot of every housing project under construction in San Francisco. Each row is a project in development.</p>
  <p>
    This data is published by the City of San Francisco <a class="highlight" href='https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Affordable-Housing-Pipeline/aaxw-2cb8' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a>, together with a data dictionary that explains the meaning of each column, which we’ve loaded in the <kbd>Data dictionary</kbd> tab.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <p class="instruction-detail">Again, let’s ask the basic questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li
      >What does each row represent?
    </li>
    <li
      >What's in each column?
    </li>
    <li
      >Are there any columns, values or codes you don't understand?
    </li>
    <li
      >Are there missing or obviously wrong values?
    </li>
    <li
      >Does the data need to be cleaned?
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Cleaning</h2>
  <p>
    This table contains many columns, which makes it difficult to navigate. Let’s narrow it down to data we’re interested in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's also add a note about the data source.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"WfModuleContextButton","moduleName":"Add from URL","button":"notes"}]'

        const have_cols = workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[1].params.colnames

        return have_cols.sort().join(',') === want_cols"
    >Add a <kbd>Select columns</kbd> step and keep the following columns (Start typing column names to pick them faster)

        <kbd>Project Units</kbd><br>

  <h2>Filter rows by condition</h2>
  <p>Let’s find out how many projects include more than 50% affordable units.</p>
  <p>
    Instead of sorting the column <kbd>% Affordable</kbd>, we’ll only keep projects that meet our condition, so that we can count them and continue working with that subset.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleSlugs[2] === 'filter'"

      <p class ="instruction-detail">
        At the top left of the table, it shows that 119 rows are left. This means that 119 projects include more than 50% affordable units.

  <h2>Multiple conditions</h2>
  <p>
    Now we can see the projects that have a majority of affordable housing. Let’s continue our exploration with the
    question: “How many of those projects contain at least 100 affordable units”?
  </p>
  <p>
    We can add another condition to keep only projects containing a minimum number affordable units.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-test="
        const filters = workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[2].params.filters

        return (
          (
            filters.filters.length === 1

  <h2>Filtering rows by values</h2>
  <p>We can also filter rows by selecting which values to include or exclude in a specific column.</p>
  <p>
    Let’s find projects that are likely to be completed by looking at the <kbd>Project Status</kbd> column.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleSlugs[3] === 'valuefilter'"
      >Add the step <kbd>Filter by Value</kbd>
    </li>
    <li
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[3].params.column === 'Project Status'"
      >Select the column <kbd>Project status</kbd>
      <p class ="instruction-detail">
        All unique values in the column <kbd>Project Status</kbd> are listed in the step, as well as how many rows use each value.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[3].params.valueselect.includes('(3) Design with Entitlements Approved')"
      >In ‘Filter by value’, select <kbd>(3) Design with entitlement Approved</kbd> to see only projects that are approved for construction, but not yet started
    </li>
    <li
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModules[3].params.valueselect.includes('(4) Site Work Permit Issued')"
      >Also select <kbd>(4) Site Work Permit Issued</kbd> to add in projects at this later stage
      <p class ="instruction-detail">
        By changing the selected values in <kbd>Filter by value</kbd> you can quickly get insight into the projects at any combination of development stages.
