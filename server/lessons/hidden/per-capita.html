  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Which city has more coffee shops: Seattle or New York? New York is a lot larger, so it almost certainly has more coffee establishments, but Seattle’s coffee culture means that there are more establishments per habitant.<br>
    Many numbers are best interpreted by comparing them to the overall population, giving a per-person rate. This is known as a per capita number (“capita” is Latin for “head”.)

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    This table is derived from the FBI Uniform Crime Report data for 2017, published and documented <a class="highlight" href='https://https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-5' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a>. <br />
    The original table published by the FBI shows crime rates per habitant. For the purpose of this exercise we removed those numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    As usual, go through your list of questions to make sure you understand the data, and decide if it needs cleaning.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <p class="instruction-detail">
    Using the data dictionary, answer the following questions for yourself:

  <h2>Absolute crime numbers</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s start with an obvious question: Which state had the highest number of violent crimes in 2017’?
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Sort <kbd>Violent crime<kbd> in descending order.
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        California is on top, with 177,627 violent crimes in 2017.
        But California is also the largest state, so this result isn’t much of an insight.<br>
        Next, let’s compare state using per capita numbers.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Crime per capita</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s reframe our question: ‘Which state has the most violent crimes per habitant?’
    The formula to calculate ‘How many (X) per (Y)’ is:
    <div class="copy-txt content-1 t-white">=(X/Y)</div>
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 3, add Formula.
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        Formulas must be written using reference cells - Column letters and rows.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Type in: <kbd>=(C1/B1)</kbd>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Name the output of the formula <kbd>Violent crime per capita</kbd>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 4, sort this new column in decreasing order.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Relative crime rates</h2>
  <p>
    These per capita crime rates are quite small: Alaska has only 0.008 violent crimes per person. Because of this, crime rates are often reported as ‘crimes per 100,000 people’.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 3, Edit your formula to <kbd>=(D1/B1)*100000</kbd>
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        This final number is often just called the “crime rate.” If you look at the FBI source, you’ll see this number reported in the table.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 3, Rename the output of Formula to ‘Crime rate’.
