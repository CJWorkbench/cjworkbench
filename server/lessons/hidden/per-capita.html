  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Which city has more coffee shops: Seattle or New York? New York is a lot larger, so it almost certainly has more coffee establishments, but Seattle’s coffee culture means that there may be  more establishments per person.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many numbers are best interpreted by comparing them to the overall population, giving a per-person rate. This is known as a per capita number (“capita” is Latin for “head”.)
  </p>
  <p>
     In this lesson you’ll learn how to calculate per capita numbers using a simple spreadsheet formula on FBI crime data.

  <h2>Absolute crime numbers</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s start with an obvious question: Which state had the highest number of violent crimes in 2017’?

      <p class="instruction-detail">
        California is on top, with 177,627 violent crimes in 2017.
        But California is also the largest state, so this result isn’t much of an insight.<br>

      <p class="instruction-detail">
        Instead, let’s compare states using per capita numbers.

  <h2>Crime per capita</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s reframe our question: ‘Which state has the most violent crimes per inhabitant?’
  </p>
  <p>
    The formula to calculate ‘How many X per Y’ is X divided by Y, or:
    <div class="copy-txt">=(X/Y)</div>

        Alaska now comes on top. It has seen 6,133 violent crimes for a total population of 739,795 - or 0.008 violent crimes per inhabitant. That is twice as much as California, which now ranks #15.

  <h2>Relative crime rates</h2>
  <p>
    These per capita crime rates are quite small: Alaska has only 0.008 violent crimes per person.<br>
    Because of this, crime rates are often reported as ‘crimes per 100,000 people’.
