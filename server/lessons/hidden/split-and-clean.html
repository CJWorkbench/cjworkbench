  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Grouping rows together is one of the most powerful ways of understanding data. This operation is sometimes called “pivot tables” or “Group by”. Its purpose is to summarize large amounts of data quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson we will focus on the classic case where one column contains multiple values that could be useful to access separately - for example in order to group.
    We will  analyze campaign contributions to Andrew Cuomo’s 2014 re-election campaign in the State of New York to find out which other state donated the most to his campaign.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    The table we’re using in this lesson has been prepared from data published and documented by the  Board of Election of the State of New York, here.
  <a class="highlight" href='https://www.elections.ny.gov/CFViewReports.html#Query' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As usual, go through your list of questions to make sure you understand the data, and decide if it needs cleaning.

  <h2>Cleaning - Splitting columns</h2>
  <p>
    We want to group donations by state, so we must extract the 2 letters state abbreviations from <kbd>Contributor</kbd> and store them into its own column so we can access it.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 2, add Select columns and keep:<br />
      <kbd>Contributor</kbd><br>
      <kbd>Amt</kbd><br>
      <kbd>State</kbd>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add the Split column in step 3 and select the column <kbd>Contributor</kbd>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Choose the method <kbd>Extract first x characters from right</kbd>Set X to ‘8’, which is the total number of characters used by the post code (5) the state abbreviation (2) and the space in between — spaces are characters!

    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Set X to <kbd>8</kbd>, which is the total number of characters used by the post code (5) the state abbreviation (2) and the space in between — spaces are characters!
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Name the new column <kbd>State</kbd>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Cleaning text</h2>
  <p>
    We now need to clean the new State column, so it only contains two letters abbreviations.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 4, add <kbd>Clean text</kbd>, and apply it to <kbd>State</kbd>.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In the 'Characters' section, set the step to delete numbers.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >With step 4 selected, rename <kbd>amt</kbd> to <kbd>Amount</kbd> by editing the column name in the table. This will create a step 5, and log your edit.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Grouping and counting</h2>
  <p>We can now calculate the amount that has been donated in each state, using groups.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 5, add 'Group' and select the column <kbd>State</kbd>.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Set the operation set to <kbd>SUM</kbd>, and choose the column <kbd>Amt</kbd> as the target.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Name the new column <kbd>Total amount</kbd>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add one more operation, and this time calculate the average donation per state. Name the new column <kbd>Average amount</kbd>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Investigate</h2>
  <p>
    Out of state campaign contributions could reveal previously hidden business or political connections. Now that we have a good summary of the provenance of money, we could for example investiguate who are the largest donors in California.
