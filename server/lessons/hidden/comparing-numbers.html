  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Is $100,000 large or small? It could be a big number in a city budget, or it could be a tiny number in a national budget. Most numbers don’t mean very much without some sort of comparison.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson we will use data from the United States Census bureau to learn three common types of comparisons: subtraction, division, and percentage change.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    This data is published by the United States Census bureau <a class="highlight" href='https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a>. <br />
    The census happens every 10 years. The last one was in 2010, so every year since then is an estimate based on more recent surveys.

  <h2>Difference</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s ask: Which county had the greatest population decrease from 2010 to  2017?
    We need to calculate the difference in population, which is a subtraction.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add <kbd>Formula</kbd>.

    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'

      >Enter the formula
      <div class="copy-txt">=D1-C1</div>
      and name the new column <kbd>Pop difference</kbd>.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Name the new column <kbd>population difference</kbd>.
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        A positive numbers means that the population increased, while a negative number means that the county’s population decreased.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Sort the resulting column in increasing order.
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        The first row will have the most negative number, meaning the county with greatest population loss.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Ratio</h2>
  <p>
    Larger counties are likely to have a greater population change. So let’s ask the question a different way:  Relative to its size, which county has lost or gained the most population? In other words: How many people in 2017 compared to the number of people in 2010? We can accomplish this with a simple division, producing a ratio.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we saw before, the formula to calculate ‘How many (X) per (Y)’ is:
    <div class="copy-txt">=(X/Y)</div>
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add Formula and type in:
      <div class="copy-txt">=(D1/C1)</div>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        Numbers greater than 1 mean the population increased. Less than 1 means that the population decreased. A ratio of 2 would mean that the population doubled.
      </p>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        The county that lost the most population between 2010 and 2017, relative to its size is:
      </p>
    </li>
    <div class="copy-txt">Type your answer here</div>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Percentage</h2>
  <p>
    There is a close relationship between ratios and percentages. A percentage is simply a fraction (a ratio) multiplied by 100:
    <div class="copy-txt">=(X/Y)*100</div>
  </p>
  <p>
    Workbench includes an easy way to calculate percentages: the Calculate step.
    <div class="copy-txt">=(X/Y)*100</div>
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add a Calculate step. Chose <kbd>X is what percent of Y</kbd>, and select <kbd>Pop estimate 2017</kbd> as X, and <kbd>Pop estimate 2010</kbd> as Y.
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        One advantage of percentages is to allow us to better grasp numbers: In 2017, the population of Concho county was 66.6% the size it was in 2010.
      </p>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        The numbers in this new column  are similar, just multiplied by 100. So <kbd>0.56</kbd> becomes <kbd>56%</kbd> and so on.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Calculating Percentage Change</h2>
  <p>
    Percentage change is the difference between old and new numbers, expressed as a percentage of the old number. The formula to calculate the percentage change between Old and New is:
    <div class="copy-txt">=((New - Old) / Old)* 100</div>
  </p>
  <p>
    You can enter this into a Formula step, or Calculate can compute this directly.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add another Calculate step and choose <kbd>Percentage change<kbd>.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Compare 2017 to 2010.
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        100% means the value doubled, 0% means it stayed the same, and a -50% change means the new number is half of the old one.
      </p>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        Percentage change allows us to describe our numbers in a new way: ‘From 2010 to 2017, Concho county lost 33.7% of its population’.
