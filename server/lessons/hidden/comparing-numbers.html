  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Is $1,000,000 large or small? It could be a big number in a city budget, or it could be a small one in a national budget. Most numbers don’t mean very much without some sort of comparison.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson we will use data from the United States Census bureau to learn three common types of comparisons: difference, ratio, and percentage change.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    This Census data is published by the United States Census bureau <a class="highlight" href='https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The census happens every 10 years. The last one was in 2010, so every year since then is an estimate based on more recent surveys.
  </p>

  <h2>Difference</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s ask: 'Which county had the greatest population decrease from 2010 to 2017?'
    We need to calculate the difference in population, which is a simple subtraction.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add <kbd>Formula</kbd>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Type in the following formula:
      <div class="copy-txt">=(D1-C1)</div>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Name the new column <kbd>Difference</kbd>.
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        A positive numbers means that the population increased, while a negative number means that the county’s population decreased.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Sort the resulting column in ascending order.
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        The first row will display the largest negative number, meaning the county with the greatest population loss.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Ratio</h2>
  <p>
    Larger counties are likely to have a greater population change. Let’s reframe:<br>
    'Relative to its size, which county has lost or gained the most population?</br> In other words: 'How many people in 2017 compared to the number of people in 2010?'
  </p>
  <p>
    The formula to calculate ‘How many (X) per (Y)’ is a simple division, also called a ratio:
    <div class="copy-txt">=(X/Y)</div>
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Insert a new Formula in step 4 (keep the previous one) and type in:
      <div class="copy-txt">=(D1/C1)</div>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Name the new column <kbd>Ratio</kbd>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        A ratio of 1 means that for every person in 2010, there is exactly 1 person in 2017.
      </p>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        Numbers greater than 1 mean the population increased. Less than 1 means the population decreased.
        A ratio of 2 would mean that the population doubled.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Percentage</h2>
  <p>
    There is a close relationship between ratios and percentages.
    A percentage is simply a fraction (a ratio) multiplied by 100:
    <div class="copy-txt">=(X/Y)*100</div>
  </p>
  <p>
    In Workbench the Calculate step lets you apply percentage formulas easily.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add a Calculate step.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Choose <kbd>X is what percent of Y</kbd>.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Select <kbd>Population estimate 2017</kbd> as X, <kbd>2010 Census</kbd> as Y, and name the output column <kbd>percentage</kbd>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        The numbers in this new column are similar to the <kbd>Ratio</kbd> column - just multiplied by 100: 0.56 becomes 56% and so on. They express the size of populations in 2017 relative to population in 2010.
      </p>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        One advantage of percentages is to allow us to better grasp numbers: 'In 2017, the population of Concho county was 66.6% the size it was in 2010.'
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<section>
  <h2>Calculating Percentage Change</h2>
  <p>
    Percentage change is the difference between old and new numbers, expressed as a percentage of the old number.
  </p>
  <p>
    The formula to calculate the percentage change between and Old and New numbers is:
    <div class="copy-txt">=((New - Old) / Old)* 100</div>
  </p>
  <p>
    We'll use Calculate to compute this easily.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add another Calculate step and choose <kbd>Percentage change<kbd>.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Select <kbd>Census 2010</kbd> as the old value and <kbd>Population estimate 2017</kbd> as the new value. Name the output column <kbd>Percentage change</kbd>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        100% means the value doubled, 0% means it stayed the same, and a -50% change means the new number is half the old one.
      </p>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        Percentage change allows us to describe our numbers in yet a new way:<br>
        ‘From 2010 to 2017, Concho county lost 33.7% of its population’.
      </p>
