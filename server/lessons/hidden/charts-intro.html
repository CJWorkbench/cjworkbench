  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Not all data stories need a data visualization. If you have only one or two numbers, they can probably just appear as text in the final story.<br>But with more data, charts are essential to quickly convey large amounts of information.
In this lesson we will work with a prepared version of the same dataset, containing the 10 largest C02 emitters since 2010.

  <h2>Column chart</h2>
  <p> Let’s first compare how much C02 has been produced by each country in 2016, using a column chart.

        Next, let’s visualize how the production of China has changed through this period.

  <h2>Tranposing</h2>
  <p> Let’s look closely at our table.<br>
    We cannot select <kbd>China</kbd>, because it is displayed as a row. We need it to be a column.
    Likewise, there is no column <kbd>Year</kbd> to select. Instead, each year is its own column.
    <br />
  </p>
  <p class="instruction-detail"> If we want to access variables that are displayed as rows, we must turn them into columns, which is called transposing.
  </p>
</section>
<section class="fullscreen">
  <h2>Transposing</h2>
  <p>
    Transposing turns rows into columns and columns into rows. Doing so, it swaps the header with the left-most column.
    Since the header does not have a name, we must name it when it becomes the new left-most column.  Likewise, after transposing, the name of the left-most column will not be displayed anymore.

  <h2>Transposing</h2>
  <p>Let’s transpose the table and compare the amount of C02 emitted by China through the years.

      > In step 2, insert the step 'Select column' and delete <kbd>Continent</kbd>, <kbd>Average</kbd> and <kbd>Maximum</kbd> so they do not get transposed.

  <h2>When to use a line chart</h2>
  <p>
    If column charts are a good choice to visually compare how much individual teams each spend in one season, a line chart is more adapted to visually express trends through time.
    The reason is that continuity can be established between points in time, and so a line can be drawn to help viewers grasp the direction of the change.
    <br>
    Line charts, however, should not be used with anything else than a horizontal axis representing time. Drawing a line between ’China’ and ‘Russia’, would make no sense: There is no in-between value, and the chart would show something that doesn’t exist!

  <h2>Line chart and series</h2>
  <p>Let’s visualize the same data, but in a line chart.
