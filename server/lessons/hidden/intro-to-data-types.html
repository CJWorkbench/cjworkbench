  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Data types are used to tell the computer how to interpret and use values.
  </p>
  <p>
    Different columns have different types: text, numbers, dates, locations, and so on. Some operations only work on specific types. For example, you can’t subtract one text value from another.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson we will use data on reported police incidents in New York to learn how Workbench guesses the types of incoming columns, and how to convert columns between types.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    The we will be working with contains all reported police incidents in January and February 2018 in the city of New York, and is published with its data dictionary <a class="highlight" href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/data' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a>.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <p class="instruction-detail">Again, let’s ask the basic questions:</p>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >What does each row represent?
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >What's in each column?
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Are there any columns, values or codes you don't understand?
    </li>
    <li

      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Are there missing or obviously wrong values?
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Does the data need to be cleaned?
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Cleaning</h2>
  <p>
    In the next lesson, we will answer the question: How many incidents were reported each month in each borough?
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, let’s narrow it down to the columns we need, and get them correctly typed.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add Select Columns, and keep only <kbd>BORO_NM</kbd> and <kbd>COMPL_FR_DT</kbd>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >You can rename columns by clicking on any column name. Rename these columns respectively to <kbd>Borough</kbd> and <kbd>Complaint date</kbd>
    </li>

  <h2>Data types</h2>
  <p>
    You may have noticed that Workbench shows the type of each column below the column name. Workbench supports 3 types:
  </p>
  <h3>Text</h3>
  <p>
    Also known as “string”, this type can contain any character and be of any length. Mixed numbers and letters are interpreted as text.</p>
  <h3>Number</h3>
  <p>
    This type is used for both whole numbers (such as 8, 22 or 268) and numbers which values have digits after the decimal point (such as 1.5 or 3.14).
  </p>
  <h3>Date & times</h3>
  <p>
    A date and a time together. In can be written in many formats, such as “23 January 2019 11:42”. Right now date & time in Workbench is shown as “2019–01-23 11:42:00”
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Converting dates</h2>
  <p>
    Although the “Complaint date” column looks like a date, you can see that it was loaded as text. Workbench tries to guess when a column is dates, but if there are any rows which are blank, not a date, or the date is in a format Workbench doesn’t recognize, the column will be loaded as text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s clean this data by setting the type of the <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> column to date & time.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In the column menu for the <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> column, select convert to <kbd>date & time</kbd>. This will add a conversion step.
      <p>
        Now this column has “Date & Time” type. You’ll use this cleaned column in the next lesson.
      </p>
