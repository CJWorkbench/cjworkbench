  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Data types are used to tell the computer how to interpret and use values.
  </p>
  <p>
    Different columns have different types: text, numbers, dates, locations, and so on. Some operations only work on specific types. For example, you can’t subtract one text value from another.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this lesson we will use data on reported police incidents in New York to learn how Workbench guesses the types of incoming columns, and how to convert columns between types.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    This data is published by the City of New York, <a class="highlight" href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/data' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a>. It contains all reported police incidents in January and February 2018.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next lesson, we will answer the question: How many incidents were reported each month in each borough? For now, let’s narrow it down to the columns we need, and get them correctly typed.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add Select Columns, and keep only <kbd>BORO_NM</kbd> and <kbd>COMPL_FR_DT</kbd>

      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >You can rename columns by clicking on any column name. Rename these columns respectively to <kbd>Borough</kbd> and <kbd>Complaint date</kbd>
    </li>

  <h2>Data types</h2>
  <p>
    You may have noticed that Workbench shows the type of each column below the column name. Workbench supports 3 types:
  </p>
  <h3>Text</h3>
  <p>
    Also known as “string”, this type can contain any character and be of any length. Mixed numbers and letters are interpreted as text.</p>
  <h3>Number</h3>
  <p>
    This type is used for both whole numbers (such as 8, 22 or 268) and numbers which values have digits after the decimal point (such as 1.5 or 3.14).
  </p>
  <h3>Date & times</h3>
  <p>
    A date and a time together. In can be written in many formats, such as “23 January 2019 11:42”. Right now date & time in Workbench is shown as “2019–01-23 11:42:00”

  <h2>Converting dates</h2>
  <p>
    Our first question is ‘How many incident were reported each month, in the entire city?
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 6, add <kbd>Group</kbd> and select the column <kbd>Complaint date</kbd>.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Check <kbd>Group dates</kbd> and select <kbd>by month</kbd> as granularity.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Name the output column<kbd>Count of incidents</kbd>.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Add one more operation, and this time calculate the average donation per state. Name the new column <kbd>Average amount</kbd>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Date granularity</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s visualize this data in a line chart to look at granularity visually.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 7, add a Line chart. Choose <kbd>Complaint date</kbd> as the X axis and plot <kbd>Count</kbd> on the Y-axis.
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        To visualize the same data but for each day, we can change the granularity of the group.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 6, edit the granularity to <kbd>by day</kbd>. Validate your edit and select the Line Chart step to view the result on your chart.
    </li>

  <h3>Investigate</h3>
  <p>Now that we have a good summary of the provenance of money, we could for example ask ‘Who are the largest donors in California?’.
    Duplicate this tab and edit the new one to find out.
