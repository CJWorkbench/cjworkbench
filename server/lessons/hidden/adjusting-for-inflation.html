  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Historical dollar amounts cannot be directly compared with dollars today, because all prices slowly change over time, due to inflation.
    Inflation is the rate of increase in prices over a given period of time.
    In this lesson you'll learn how to compare amounts from different years using data from the bureau of labor statistics.

  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>
    The table in the first tab has been prepared using data published and documented by the National Center for Education Statistics, <a class="highlight" href='https://nces.ed.gov/' target="_blank" className="info-1">here</a>. <br />
    It shows the average annual salaries of teachers in public elementary and secondary schools, in the U.S, for selected year from 1969-70 through 2016-17.
    Those numbers are in ‘Current dollars’, which means not adjusted for inflation.
    Let’s convert them in today’s dollar.

  <h2>Using CPI</h2>
  <p>
    In order to convert an old dollar amount into a current dollar amount, we need to:<br>
    First, divide the old dollar amount by the CPI for that year<br>
    Then, multiply it by the CPI for the current year.<br>
    To do this, we need first to join our two tables.<br>
  </p>
  <p> Since both tables have a year variable, we’ll join using the Year.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Joining tables</h2>
  <p>
    There is a close relationship between ratios and percentages. A percentage is simply a fraction (a ratio) multiplied by 100:
    <div class="copy-txt content-1 t-white">=(X/Y)*100</div>
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Switch back to the `Teachers salaries` tab and add a Join module in step 2.
    </li>
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >Select the CPI tab to join with, and the `year` column to match.
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        The Join module takes each available value in the ‘Year’ column of the Teacher salaries’ table and finds the corresponding row in the CPI table.
      </p>
      <p class=instruction-detail>
        Joining is a powerful step that you can use to build datasets using tables from various sources, each containing different information.
        By bringing them together, the value of that information increases significantly.
      </p>
    </li>

  <h2>Adjusting for inflation</h2>
  <p>
    The formula for converting an old dollar amount (Amt1) into an equivalent current dollar amount (Amt2) is:
    <div class="copy-txt content-1 t-white">Amt2=(Amt1/CPI1)*CPI2</div>
    In other words: <br>
    First, divide the old dollar amount by the CPI for that year. Then, multiply it by the CPI for the current year.
  </p>
  <h3 class="instructions">Instructions</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li
      data-highlight='[{"type":"Module","index":0,"name":"Add from URL"}]'
      data-test="return workflow.tabs[0].wfModuleNames[0] === 'Add from URL'"
      >In step 3, Add Formula and type in:
      <div class="copy-txt content-1 t-white">=(Amt1/CPI1)*240.007</div>
      <p class="instruction-detail">
        Once adjusted for inflation, we can see that the salaries of teachers in public elementary and secondary schools, in the U.S, had decreased from 2009 to 2016, which was not apparent in the original table.
