    Delete cached results that have empty column names.

    Prior to https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/162648330, there was no
    check in place to prevent empty columns from existing. We have since
    modified every module that creates columns to ensure it never outputs an
    empty column name. This migration "fixes" all the "pass-thru" modules that
    don't modify input column names: to ensure their _output_ valid, we need to
    ensure their _input_ is valid. That means running the modules that produce
    their input.

    Clear all cache results with empty column names.
