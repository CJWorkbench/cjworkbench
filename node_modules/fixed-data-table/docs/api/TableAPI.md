Props
-----

### `width` (required)

Pixel width of table. If all columns do not fit,
a horizontal scrollbar will appear.

type: `number`


### `height`

Pixel height of table. If all rows do not fit,
a vertical scrollbar will appear.

Either `height` or `maxHeight` must be specified.

type: `number`


### `borderHeight`

Pixel height of table's border. Default is 1px.

type: `number`
defaultValue: `1`


### `maxHeight`

Maximum pixel height of table. If all rows do not fit,
a vertical scrollbar will appear.

Either `height` or `maxHeight` must be specified.

type: `number`


### `ownerHeight`

Pixel height of table's owner, this is used in a managed scrolling
situation when you want to slide the table up from below the fold
without having to constantly update the height on every scroll tick.
Instead, vary this property on scroll. By using `ownerHeight`, we
over-render the table while making sure the footer and horizontal
scrollbar of the table are visible when the current space for the table
in view is smaller than the final, over-flowing height of table. It
allows us to avoid resizing and reflowing table when it is moving in the
view.

This is used if `ownerHeight < height` (or `maxHeight`).

type: `number`


### `overflowX`

type: `enum('hidden'|'auto')`


### `overflowY`

type: `enum('hidden'|'auto')`


### `rowsCount` (required)

Number of rows in the table.

type: `number`


### `rowHeight` (required)

Pixel height of rows unless `rowHeightGetter` is specified and returns
different value.

type: `number`


### `rowHeightGetter`

If specified, `rowHeightGetter(index)` is called for each row and the
returned value overrides `rowHeight` for particular row.

type: `func`


### `rowClassNameGetter`

To get any additional CSS classes that should be added to a row,
`rowClassNameGetter(index)` is called.

type: `func`


### `groupHeaderHeight`

Pixel height of the column group header.

type: `number`
defaultValue: `0`


### `headerHeight` (required)

Pixel height of header.

type: `number`
defaultValue: `0`


### `footerHeight`

Pixel height of footer.

type: `number`
defaultValue: `0`


### `scrollLeft`

Value of horizontal scroll.

type: `number`
defaultValue: `0`


### `scrollToColumn`

Index of column to scroll to.

type: `number`


### `scrollTop`

Value of vertical scroll.

type: `number`
defaultValue: `0`


### `scrollToRow`

Index of row to scroll to.

type: `number`


### `onScrollStart`

Callback that is called when scrolling starts with current horizontal
and vertical scroll values.

type: `func`


### `onScrollEnd`

Callback that is called when scrolling ends or stops with new horizontal
and vertical scroll values.

type: `func`


### `onRangeChange`

Callback that is called when the visible row and column indexes change.
The first argument looks like {rows: [0, 5], columns: [2, 4]}, where
columns include indexes of only the scrollable scolumns. Both intervals
are half open. The second argument is 'wheel', 'scrollbar', or 'props'
indicating why the viewport changed.

type: `func`


### `onContentHeightChange`

Callback that is called when `rowHeightGetter` returns a different height
for a row than the `rowHeight` prop. This is necessary because initially
table estimates heights of some parts of the content.

type: `func`


### `onRowClick`

Callback that is called when a row is clicked.

type: `func`


### `onRowDoubleClick`

Callback that is called when a row is double clicked.

type: `func`


### `onRowMouseDown`

Callback that is called when a mouse-down event happens on a row.

type: `func`


### `onRowMouseEnter`

Callback that is called when a mouse-enter event happens on a row.

type: `func`


### `onRowMouseLeave`

Callback that is called when a mouse-leave event happens on a row.

type: `func`


### `onColumnResizeEndCallback`

Callback that is called when resizer has been released
and column needs to be updated.

Required if the isResizable property is true on any column.

```
function(
  newColumnWidth: number,
  columnKey: string,
)
```

type: `func`


### `isColumnResizing`

Whether a column is currently being resized.

type: `bool`


### `isRTL`

Whether the table is shown Right-to-Left

type: `bool`


### `bufferRowCount`

The number of rows outside the viewport to prerender. Defaults to roughly
half of the number of visible rows.
