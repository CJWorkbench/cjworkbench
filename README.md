#  The data journalism platform with built-in training

Welcome to Workbench! (CJ for computational journalism)

- Our [public server](http://workbenchdata.com), now in beta.

Workbench is a platform that combines data tools and training for journalists. It is a workbook-style data processing system designed around modular tools for data processing -- table in, table out -- with no code required. Features include:

- An integrated data journalism training program
- Modules to scrape, clean, analyze and visualize data
- Every action is recorded, so all workflows are repeatable and transparent
- Connect to Google Drive, Twitter, and API endpoints.
- All data is live and versioned, and you can monitor for changes.
- Write custom modules in Python + Javascript and add them to the module library

# Try it
