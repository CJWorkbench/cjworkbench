# Spreadsheet, meet automation.

Welcome to Workbench!

Workbench is a platform that helps you make sense of data tables. Code like a pro -- without code.

Features include:

- Steps to download, HTML-scrape, clean, analyze and visualize data.
- Steps to load tables from Google Drive, Twitter and APIs.
- Emailed notifications when data changes.
- An integrated data-journalism training course.
- Undo, so you can't make mistakes -- only experiments.
- Unlimited power, with custom Python and Excel-like formulas.

# Try it

To see what Workbench does, run your [own server](https://github.com/CJWorkbench/cjworkbench/wiki/Deployment).
