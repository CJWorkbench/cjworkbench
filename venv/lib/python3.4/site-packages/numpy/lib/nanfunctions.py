    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like

    infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32`.  Specifying a
    higher-precision accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can alleviate
    this issue.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : {int, sequence of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the medians are computed. The default
        is to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.
        A sequence of axes is supported since version 1.9.0.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
       If True, then allow use of memory of input array `a` for
       calculations. The input array will be modified by the call to
       `median`. This will save memory when you do not need to preserve
       the contents of the input array. Treat the input as undefined,
       but it will probably be fully or partially sorted. Default is
       False. If `overwrite_input` is ``True`` and `a` is not already an
       `ndarray`, an error will be raised.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    median : ndarray
        A new array holding the result. If the input contains integers
        or floats smaller than ``float64``, then the output data-type is
        ``np.float64``.  Otherwise, the data-type of the output is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the median of ``V`` is the
    middle value of a sorted copy of ``V``, ``V_sorted`` - i.e.,
    ``V_sorted[(N-1)/2]``, when ``N`` is odd and the average of the two
    middle values of ``V_sorted`` when ``N`` is even.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    q : float in range of [0,100] (or sequence of floats)
        Percentile to compute, which must be between 0 and 100
        inclusive.
    axis : {int, sequence of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the percentiles are computed. The
        default is to compute the percentile(s) along a flattened
        version of the array. A sequence of axes is supported since
        version 1.9.0.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,

    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow use of memory of input array `a` for
        calculations. The input array will be modified by the call to
        `percentile`. This will save memory when you do not need to
        preserve the contents of the input array. In this case you
        should not make any assumptions about the contents of the input
        `a` after this function completes -- treat it as undefined.
        Default is False. If `a` is not already an array, this parameter
        will have no effect as `a` will be converted to an array
        internally regardless of the value of this parameter.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
        use when the desired quantile lies between two data points
        ``i < j``:
            * linear: ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction`` is
              the fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i`` and
              ``j``.
            * lower: ``i``.
            * higher: ``j``.
            * nearest: ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.
            * midpoint: ``(i + j) / 2``.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

    Returns
    -------
    percentile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple percentiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the percentiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input 
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    nanmean, nanmedian, percentile, median, mean

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the ``q``-th percentile of
    ``V`` is the value ``q/100`` of the way from the mimumum to the
    maximum in in a sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of
    the two nearest neighbors as well as the `interpolation` parameter
    will determine the percentile if the normalized ranking does not
    match the location of ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as
    the median if ``q=50``, the same as the minimum if ``q=0`` and the
    same as the maximum if ``q=100``.

    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the variance is computed.  The default is to compute

    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the variance.  For arrays of integer type

        the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional

    ddof : int, optional
        "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
        ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
        elements. By default `ddof` is zero.

    -------
    variance : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the variance,
        otherwise return a reference to the output array. If ddof is >= the
        number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice contains only
        NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    --------
    std : Standard deviation
    mean : Average
    var : Variance while not ignoring NaNs
    nanstd, nanmean
    numpy.doc.ufuncs : Section "Output arguments"

    Notes
    -----
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
    i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

    The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
    instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite
    population.  ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the
    variance for normally distributed variables.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])

        Axis along which the standard deviation is computed. The default is
        to compute the standard deviation of the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type to use in computing the standard deviation. For arrays of
        integer type the default is float64, for arrays of float types it
        is the same as the array type.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output but the type (of the
        calculated values) will be cast if necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        Means Delta Degrees of Freedom.  The divisor used in calculations
        is ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
        elements.  By default `ddof` is zero.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    standard_deviation : ndarray, see dtype parameter above.
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the standard
        deviation, otherwise return a reference to the output array. If
        ddof is >= the number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice
        contains only NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    Notes
    -----
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean: ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

    The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
    ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is
    specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard
    statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the
    variance of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum
    likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables.
    The standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute value before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same
    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype`
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, np.nan], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.nanstd(a)
    1.247219128924647
    >>> np.nanstd(a, axis=0)
    array([ 1.,  0.])
    >>> np.nanstd(a, axis=1)
    array([ 0.,  0.5])

    """
    var = nanvar(a, axis=axis, dtype=dtype, out=out, ddof=ddof,
                 keepdims=keepdims)
    if isinstance(var, np.ndarray):
        std = np.sqrt(var, out=var)
    else:
        std = var.dtype.type(np.sqrt(var))
    return std
